"""Structural coherence checks against the derived implication frame ⟨B, I_M⟩.

Phase 2.1 of the construct-validity infrastructure (per *Closing the
Construct-Validity Gap in infereval*). Addresses **R13** (structural
coherence check on the derived frame) — the philosophically central
addition that moves the framework from "supporting agreement
measurement" to "supporting mastery characterization in the
inferentialist sense" (Hlobil & Brandom 2025; Brandom 1994; Allen 2026
Remark 5).

The Hlobil–Brandom framework treats a handful of structural properties
as constitutive of inferential mastery. The framework guarantees one of
them by construction (**containment closure**, clause i of Definition 3);
the others have to be *checked against the evaluation outcome*. This
module implements those checks as first-class operations so that
aggregate agreement statistics aren't conflated with structural mastery.

Three checks ship in this module:

- :func:`containment_closure_check` — sanity check that all
  self-implications (items where ``Γ ∩ Δ ≠ ∅``) are in ``I_M`` by
  construction.
- :func:`rsr_role_consistency_check` — for items carrying a role tag
  (``supporter`` / ``defeater`` / ``irrelevant-addition``) and an
  ``rsr_target``, compare the model's verdict against the verdict the
  role *predicts* given the base-inference verdict on the same target.
- :func:`base_case_stability_check` — when an ``rsr_target`` has
  multiple base-inference items, the model should give the same verdict
  on all of them.

Each check returns a :class:`StructuralCheck` dataclass with a count of
items checked, items satisfying the property, a list of anomalies, and
a derived rate. :func:`run_all_checks` returns a
:class:`StructuralReport` bundling the three.
